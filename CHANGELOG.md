@Aditya
  - deleted random unused files & folder, such as `databaselog.md`  and  ` backend` 





## [1.10] - 2024-10-25 (25th October 2024) 

## Added 

@ Jaden 
- Firebase auth is set up and working. It saves each user with a unique ID and all the other user data is still stored in the real-time database
- I added a new attribute status that is set to 'pending' when creating an account. There is no way to change it as of yet
- When you login as admin, there is now a page called 'admin_requests_inbox' that lists all the pending requests using a RecyclerView that displays items of class 'RegistrationRequest' using the 'RequestAdapter' class


# Still to implement 
- The approve/reject buttons do not do anything yet
- Logic on the attendee/organizer login forms to allow you only to login when your status changes to accepted
- Message informing rejected requests that they need to contact administrator
- The UI could be better if you wish
